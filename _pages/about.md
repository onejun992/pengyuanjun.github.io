## PENG YUANJUN / 팽원균 / ほうげんきん（彭塬鈞）

My academic research focuses on East Asian cultural contents, with particular attention to **Japanese subculture**, **ACG (Animation, Comics, Games) cultural contents**, and **Korea–China cultural content exchange**.

My work explores cultural hybridity, digital platforms, and transnational media flows in contemporary East Asian popular culture.
