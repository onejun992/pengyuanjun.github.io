## Research Profile

I received my Ph.D. in Cultural Contents from the Department of Global Cultural Contents at Sangmyung University, Korea.

My primary field of research is Cultural Contents Studies, with cultural hybridity as a central conceptual framework.
I focus in particular on Japanese subculture, otaku culture, and two-dimensional (ACG: animation, comics, and games) contents and cultures.

Within the East Asian socio-cultural context, my research pays close attention to cultural export and reversed cultural flows,
as well as processes of globalization, glocalization, and hybridization as forms of cultural transition.

From the perspective of cultural contents re-creation and the reconstruction of meaning,
I conduct in-depth analysis and interpretation of cultural commodities and media contents.

## Research Background

My academic interest lies in cultural contents studies, with a particular focus on ACG (Animation, Comics, and Games) cultures and cultural hybridity in East Asia. My research is grounded in long-term engagement with Japanese popular culture and its transnational circulation, especially within contemporary Chinese digital media environments.

I conceptualize culture as a dynamic and bidirectional process rather than a one-way flow from dominant to peripheral regions. Cultural exchange often involves reciprocal influence, conflict, negotiation, and eventual hybridization, producing new cultural forms and meanings. This perspective has guided my interest in cultural hybridity as a key analytical framework.

My recent research has focused on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili as a representative site of cultural hybridity, where Japanese subcultural elements, local youth cultures, and platform-based participatory practices intersect. In parallel, I examine the development of China’s cultural industries in the context of global cultural circulation, including the international expansion of digital games and animation since 2020.

More broadly, my research aims to explore how cultural contents are produced, transformed, and circulated under conditions of globalization, and how platformization and transnational media practices contribute to the reconfiguration of cultural industries and cultural identities in contemporary East Asia.

## Personal Values & Academic Disposition

Through more than twelve years of academic study and everyday life in Korea,  
I have cultivated strong perseverance, ethical self-discipline, and a respectful attitude  
toward others. I value kindness, patience, and integrity as fundamental principles  
guiding both my academic work and interpersonal relationships.  
Careful attention to detail, a cautious yet forward-looking mindset, and a strong sense  
of responsibility constitute the foundation of my academic disposition.

A defining feature of my academic life has been a long-standing commitment to discipline  
and reliability. From early education through doctoral training, I have consistently  
maintained rigorous personal standards regarding time management and task completion,  
approaching academic responsibilities with punctuality, preparedness, and respect  
for institutional schedules. I regard timely engagement and conscientious execution  
not as exceptional qualities, but as essential conditions for sustaining trust  
within academic and organizational environments.

An important formative experience occurred during my late adolescence.  
At the age of seventeen, I successfully achieved a substantial and sustained physical  
transformation, reducing my body weight from approximately 100 kilograms to 70 kilograms  
within a limited period, and maintaining regular physical training, healthy routines,  
and disciplined daily habits thereafter. This experience reinforced my understanding of  
long-term commitment, self-regulation, and consistency as foundational principles applicable  
not only to personal well-being, but also to academic research and professional life.

In addition, my experience of more than two years as a trainee within the Korean  
entertainment industry has shaped my sensitivity to cultural production systems,  
aesthetic standards, and the operational dynamics of the creative industries.  
This background has contributed to my sustained interest in popular culture, fashion,  
and entertainment as structured cultural fields rather than purely expressive domains.

Extended periods of independent living abroad have strengthened my capacity to confront  
challenges autonomously and to respond to uncertainty with composure and resilience.  
Combined with a reflective, inward-oriented, and meaning-driven personal disposition—  
often associated with the INFJ personality profile—I approach problems by seeking  
their underlying structures rather than surface phenomena. This orientation has fostered  
a habit of analytical depth, anticipatory thinking, and long-term planning.

Overall, I consider academic work to be grounded not only in intellectual ability,  
but also in character, consistency, and responsibility. These values shape my approach  
to research, collaboration, and engagement within both academic and cultural contexts.
